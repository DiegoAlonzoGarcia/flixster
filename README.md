### Notes
Challenges encountered while building the app:
- The first time I built the application I lost my whole advance since despite creating the repository I did not "commit" and "push" the project from Xcode. Without committing and pushing, after finishing the requirements of the assignment, I tried to make some improvements to the project. Then when I realized that these changes were not what I expected, I hit the "Discard all changes" option. This action led me to lose the full implementation of my project. Afterwards, I rebuilt my application from scratch. Although losing all my progress was a frustrating moment, thanks to this situation from now on I will be conscious of making sure to "commit" and "push" the progress of my projects.
